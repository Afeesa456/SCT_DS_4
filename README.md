# 🚦 US Traffic Accident Data Analysis

This project analyzes **US traffic accident data** to identify patterns related to **road conditions, weather, and time of day**. The goal is to visualize **accident hotspots** and understand the **factors contributing** to accidents.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Objective**:  
  - Explore accident data in the US  
  - Identify high-risk road conditions and times  
  - Visualize accident hotspots across different regions  

- **Dataset**: US Accident Dataset
  - Contains details about accidents such as location, time, weather, and road conditions.

- **Approach**:  
  1. Data loading and cleaning  
  2. Feature analysis (road condition, weather, time of day)  
  3. Accident hotspot detection  
  4. Visualization of contributing factors

## 📂 Dataset Information
**Key features include:**
- `Start_Time` → Time of the accident  
- `Weather_Condition` → Weather during accident  
- `Temperature`, `Humidity`, `Visibility`, `Wind_Speed`  
- `Street`, `City`, `State`, `Zipcode`  
- `Severity` → Severity of accident (1–4)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas / Numpy** → Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** → Visualization  
- **Folium / Plotly** → Mapping accident hotspots

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Accidents by time of day** (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)  
- **Accidents by weather condition** (Clear, Rain, Fog, Snow, etc.)  
- **Accidents by road condition** (Dry, Wet, Icy)  
- **Heatmaps of accident hotspots** by location
